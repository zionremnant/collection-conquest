## Summary

The team collaboratively created a MERN stack single-page application designing and building an application using the React for the front-end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database, and queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

## Products and Services

The application offers a MERN stack single-page application called Collection Conquest using CSS, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM. Our application also manages a database to catalog a user’s favorite personal collection to keep track of future collectibles. Our web application will serve and provide the convenience for users to access their collections.

## User Story

- Type of User - Collectors.
